The solution is to always use strict comparison (`===`) unless type coercion is explicitly desired.

```php
$a = 1;
$b = "1";

if ($a === $b) { //Strict comparison using ===
  echo "Values are identical"; //This will NOT execute
}

if ($a == $b) { //Loose comparison using ==
  echo "Values are equal"; //This will execute
}

//To demonstrate a case where loose comparison might be intended:
$c = 1;
$d = true; // Boolean true is equivalent to integer 1 in loose comparison

if ($c == $d) {
  echo "Values are loosely equal, demonstrating intended loose comparison";
}

if ($c === $d) {
    echo "Values are strictly identical"; //This will NOT execute
}
```
By using `===`, the code becomes more robust and less prone to unexpected type-related errors.
