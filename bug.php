In PHP, a common yet often overlooked error is the misuse of the `===` (identical) operator versus the `==` (equal) operator.  This can lead to unexpected behavior when comparing values of different types.

Example:
```php
$a = 1;
$b = "1";

if ($a == $b) { //Loose comparison using ==
  echo "Values are equal";
}

if ($a === $b) { //Strict comparison using ===
  echo "Values are identical";
}
```

In the example above, `$a == $b` will evaluate to `true` because PHP's loose comparison converts the string "1" to an integer 1 before comparison. However, `$a === $b` will evaluate to `false` because `===` checks for both value and type equality.  This subtle difference can cause hard-to-find bugs.
